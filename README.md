# 🌟 Mattthew's Dotfiles 🌟

Welcome to **Mattthew's Dotfiles**! This repository contains my personal configuration files, commonly known as dotfiles. These files help set up my development environment efficiently and keep my tools organized. 

## 📥 Download and Setup

You can download the latest version of my dotfiles from the [Releases](https://github.com/Krsta97/Mattthew-s-Dotfiles/releases) section. Once you have downloaded the appropriate file, please execute it to set up your environment.

## 🛠️ What are Dotfiles?

Dotfiles are configuration files for various applications and shell environments. They are usually hidden files (hence the dot prefix) that store user preferences and settings. By customizing these files, you can optimize your workflow and tailor your environment to suit your needs.

### Common Dotfiles You Might Find

- **.bashrc**: Configures your Bash shell.
- **.vimrc**: Settings for the Vim text editor.
- **.gitconfig**: Customizes Git settings.
- **.tmux.conf**: Configures the Tmux terminal multiplexer.

## 🌐 Why Use Dotfiles?

Using dotfiles allows you to:

1. **Maintain Consistency**: Keep your development environment the same across multiple machines.
2. **Save Time**: Quickly set up a new machine with your preferred settings.
3. **Share Configurations**: Easily share your configurations with others or use configurations from others.

## 🖥️ How to Use These Dotfiles

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krsta97/Mattthew-s-Dotfiles.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Mattthew-s-Dotfiles
   ```

3. **Run the Setup Script**:
   ```bash

This script will copy the dotfiles to your home directory and apply the necessary configurations.
